# interkasten Philosophy

## Purpose
Living bridge between your projects folder and Notion — bidirectional sync with adaptive AI documentation and pagent workflow automation

## North Star
Keep bidirectional sync safe and legible: no silent divergence, explicit conflict handling, and clear operator feedback.

## Working Priorities
- Sync correctness
- Conflict handling
- Operator clarity

## Brainstorming Doctrine
1. Start from outcomes and failure modes, not implementation details.
2. Generate at least three options: conservative, balanced, and aggressive.
3. Explicitly call out assumptions, unknowns, and dependency risk across modules.
4. Prefer ideas that improve clarity, reversibility, and operational visibility.

## Planning Doctrine
1. Convert selected direction into small, testable, reversible slices.
2. Define acceptance criteria, verification steps, and rollback path for each slice.
3. Sequence dependencies explicitly and keep integration contracts narrow.
4. Reserve optimization work until correctness and reliability are proven.

## Decision Filters
- Does this reduce ambiguity for future sessions?
- Does this improve reliability without inflating cognitive load?
- Is the change observable, measurable, and easy to verify?
- Can we revert safely if assumptions fail?
